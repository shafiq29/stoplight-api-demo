The LT Trust API is a RESTful API. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented  URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.  JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

LT Trust supports two API environments TEST and PROD.  The TEST domain is rc.ltetire.com, and the PROD domain is connect.ltretire.com.  This documentation only contains references to TEST.---
